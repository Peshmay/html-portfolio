<p><h3>Why Back-End Developer</h3></p>

<p>In today's digital world, back-end development is the backbone of virtually all online platforms and applications.
My passion for programming began in childhood, which led me to study telecommunications engineering and robotics.
These fields have equipped me with a solid foundation of technology.
With Back-End developer, I will have opportunity to create the backbone of websites and applications.
I want to master server management, APIs, and databases. I believe that developing strong back-end skills will
allow me to build comprehensive solutions and collaborate effectively with front-end developers.
As an aspiring back-end developer, I see this as my chance to make a difference, especially in a male-dominated field.
I am also motivated by a desire to inspire others particularly women showing anyone can succeed if given a chance. I view this opportunity not only as a personal milestone but also as a way to stand up for others who might face similar barriers.</p>
